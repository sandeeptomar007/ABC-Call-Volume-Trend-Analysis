# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze the dataset of an ABC company's inbound call center for the insurance category. The dataset includes information such as agent names, queue time, call time, call duration, call status, and other relevant details.

The objectives of the project are to calculate the average call time duration for incoming calls in each time bucket, visualize the total volume of calls over
time, and propose a manpower plan to reduce the abandon rate to 10% during specific time periods.

Additionally, the project involves addressing the issue of unanswered calls during the night and proposing a manpower plan for that time period as well.

## Approach
* Import the dataset into Excel Sheets.
* Clean the data by removing any irrelevant columns or rows.
* Calculate the average call time duration for incoming calls in each time bucket by using appropriate formulas or functions.
* Create a chart or graph to visualize the total volume of calls over time.
* Analyze the current abandon rate and calculate the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.
* Analyze the distribution of calls during the night and propose a manpower plan to address the issue of unanswered calls.
* Consider the assumptions regarding the agent's work schedule and calculate the required number of agents in each time bucket.
* Summarize the findings and insights in a report.

## Tech Stack Used
Microsoft Excel (2021) - used for data analysis, calculations, and visualization.

## Finding Insights

1. Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket).
2. Show the total volume/ number of calls coming in via charts/ graphs [Number of calls v/s Time]. You can select time in a bucket form (i.e. 1-2, 2-3, …..)
3. As you can see current abandon rate is approximately 30%. Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket [between 9 am to 9 pm] to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. (i.e. You have to calculate a minimum number of agents required in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.)
4. Let’s say customers also call this ABC insurance company at night but didn’t get an answer as there are no agents to answer, this creates a bad customer experience for this Insurance company. Suppose for every 100 calls that the customer made from 9 Am to 9 Pm, the customer also made 30 calls in the night between interval [9 Pm to 9 Am] and the distribution of those 30 calls are as follows:


## Result
By performing the analysis and implementing the proposed manpower plans, the project aims to achieve the following:

* Gain insights into call durations in different time buckets, facilitating better resource management and planning.
* Provide visual representations of call volume trends over time, enabling better decision-making regarding staffing requirements.
* Propose a manpower plan to reduce the abandon rate from 30% to 10% during specified time periods, leading to improved customer satisfaction.
* Propose a manpower plan to address unanswered calls during the night, ensuring a better customer experience round the clock.
* The project report will serve as a valuable resource for the leadership team to understand and optimize the performance of the ABC company's inbound call center.
